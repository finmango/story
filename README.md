# FinMango Story
This is a template used for FinMango AMP stories. To create a new story, all you have to do add the
corresponding JSON file to the [lessons folder](./lessons) with the appropriate configuration. For
an example to use as a reference, take a look at the
[money cycle lesson](./lessons/money-cycle.json).

Every time the main branch of this repository is updated, a story is generated for each of the JSON
files in the lessons folder. The stories can be accessed at the following URL:
`https://finmango.github.io/story/<story-name>/`. For example, the story for the money cycle lesson
can be found here: https://finmango.github.io/story/money-cycle/.
