A short thread on what it means and the magic of continous improvement... Kaizen is a Japanese word meaning ""improvement.""",https://drive.google.com/file/d/187EWejNAH75f2-cmk5BDQ9Ficpgutzl6/view?usp=sharing,Background continued,"In practice, the term is used to convey continuous improvement. It is a dynamic process - ongoing, incremental, compounding daily improvements. The orgin of the conept of Kaizen is long, winding, and global in nature. ",https://drive.google.com/file/d/187EWejNAH75f2-cmk5BDQ9Ficpgutzl6/view?usp=sharing,A little history,"In the 1930s, Walter Shewhart - a Bell Labs engineer - had developed the Plan-Do-Study-Acty System (PDSA) to assess the effectiveness of organizaitonal changes in driving continued business improvement. Shewhart had mentored W. Edwards Deming, who went to Japan after WWII as part of the post-war recovery. ",https://drive.google.com/file/d/187EWejNAH75f2-cmk5BDQ9Ficpgutzl6/view?usp=sharing,History continued,"Deming implemnted and imporved upon his mentor's ideas and helped to drive the remarkable post-war economic growth in Japan. But the concept of Kaizen began to build a mainstream following with the works of Masaaki Imai, a Japanese organizational theorist and consultant. ",https://drive.google.com/file/d/187EWejNAH75f2-cmk5BDQ9Ficpgutzl6/view?usp=sharing,History continued,"In 1986, he published a best-seller called ""Kaizen: The Key to Japan's Competitive Success"" and founded The Kaizen Institute. Kaizen prioritizes small, daily improvements (rather than large, step-function leaps). ",https://drive.google.com/file/d/187EWejNAH75f2-cmk5BDQ9Ficpgutzl6/view?usp=sharing,Summary,It teaches that progress and growth are the result of daily actions to drive the small improvements. It teaches that progress and growth are achievable for anyone willing to put in the work. ,https://drive.google.com/file/d/187EWejNAH75f2-cmk5BDQ9Ficpgutzl6/view?usp=sharing,Conclusion,"""If you get one percent better each day for one year, you'll end up thirty-seven times better by the time you're done."" The math doesn't lie. Kaizen - continous improvemnt - is the way. ""The journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step."" - Lao Tzu",https://drive.google.com/file/d/187EWejNAH75f2-cmk5BDQ9Ficpgutzl6/view?usp=sharing,Conclusion continued,"""If you get one percent as you embark on your own thousand-mile journey - whether in your career or life - always remember the incredible power of small, consistent, daily progress. Always remember the power of Kaizen. ",https://drive.google.com/file/d/187EWejNAH75f2-cmk5BDQ9Ficpgutzl6/view?usp=sharing,,,,,,
Scott Glasgow,https://finlit.finmango.org/spdi,Rethinking Finance,SPDI Methodology,What is it and how does it work?,https://drive.google.com/file/d/1YKQ0AV6tgF95UxvlUQEGEFS5h3cfOaw9/view?usp=sharing,Background,"In product development, there are no silver bullets. Smart Program Development and Implementation (aka SPDI) is a groundbreaking approach to problem solving for policy, programs, or products. In consists of six steps: (1) Idenitfy, (2) Diagnose, (3) Design, (4) Implment, (5) Test, (6) Refine.",https://drive.google.com/file/d/187EWejNAH75f2-cmk5BDQ9Ficpgutzl6/view?usp=sharing,Step 1: Identify,"The first step is to identify the problem. While this may occur in many ways, a successful model is when the involved stakeholders come together with researchers to combine information on priorities and opportunities with economic insights in order to identify a question that can be feasibly approached.",https://drive.google.com/file/d/187EWejNAH75f2-cmk5BDQ9Ficpgutzl6/view?usp=sharing,Step 2: Diagnose,"Work closely with partners, again using insights from theory and empirical evidence, to diagnose the market or failures that underlie the identified problem. Descriptive data and existing research can often help distinguish between potential explanations and screen for underlying causal factors.",https://drive.google.com/file/d/187EWejNAH75f2-cmk5BDQ9Ficpgutzl6/view?usp=sharing,Step 3: Design,"Step three is about applying the collective expertise to design innovations that are financially, administratively, and politically feasible in addition to being justified by economic principles and well-supported by evidence. Monitoring and feedback mechanisms are built into every design. The goal is to solve the real problem based on evidence, not our opinions.",https://drive.google.com/file/d/187EWejNAH75f2-cmk5BDQ9Ficpgutzl6/view?usp=sharing,Step 4: Implement,"This is the point when the solution is delivered to target beneficiaries. Sometimes potential designs are implemented in an initial pilot to iron out the kinks or determine feasibility before delivering them at scale. Smart data systems capture key indicators of implementation progress to enable continuous problem-solving and learning.
",https://drive.google.com/file/d/187EWejNAH75f2-cmk5BDQ9Ficpgutzl6/view?usp=sharing,Step 5: Test,"The SPDI approach emphasizes rigorous testing at relevant scale, with scientific methods of evaluation used to measure impact – often comparing several designs via large-scale field studies that draw on tools such as randomized controlled trials. Testing the outcomes of the highest potential solution(s) provides key information on how best to improve and refine the policy and may open up the next frontier of policy questions with new evidence on the nature of the problem.",https://drive.google.com/file/d/187EWejNAH75f2-cmk5BDQ9Ficpgutzl6/view?usp=sharing,Step 6: Refine,"SPDI is an iterative approach, where the lessons learned at each stage are used to refine existing designs and identify the next set of objectives. At the refine stage, the policy-research team may decide that it would be most advantageous to return to a previous point in the process to solve problems or integrate new knowledge. The aim is to use evidence to generate a cycle of continuous policy improvement.",https://drive.google.com/file/d/187EWejNAH75f2-cmk5BDQ9Ficpgutzl6/view?usp=sharing,Conclusion,"Creating impact is a process and follows agile methodology. It's important to fail fast, fail often, and continuously measure the outcomes to improve quickly. Those that embrace failure will see more success.
