Bonds have a \u201ccoupon price\u201d that comes with a set amount of time that the bond will exist for. The coupon price tacks on \u201cInterest\u201d for the borrower and by the end of the bond, the lender will walk away with more than they came with. That also increases the price of the bond itself. Borrowers can make a quick turn around to not steer off track of their business plans.</p>",
