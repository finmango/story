			"text": "<p>Diversification is the action of creating a investing portfolio with many different companies rather than just a single type of company that all share the same traits. This is a risk management strategy which means it is safer to have other assets to rely on if the market fluctuates negatively towards a type of market in a period of time</p>",

As Roger scans through the market, he finds Tesla is down to $620.23 per stock. Roger decides to invest his money in both and keep the remaining buying power for later. Having a dip in both companies rather than just one, Roger has secured a back up in case one stock underperforms more during the period of time he owns it.</p>",
