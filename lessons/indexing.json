He uses the Consumer Price Index to calculate the rate of inflation before getting into indexing the S&P Index 500. He also uses the CPI to adjust his interest rates for these investments and realizes the numbers work well with his plan and he decides he wants to mimic the performance of the market for the most success in his goals.</p>",
