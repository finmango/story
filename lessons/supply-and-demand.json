If she raises the price to $5, then only 600 consumers will be willing to buy the juice and she will make a profit of $60. If she lowers the price to $3, then 1,400 consumers will be willing to buy the juice and she will make a profit of $140.</p><p>Tatiana will choose to produce where she makes the most profit. Thus, Tatiana will price her juice at $3 and produce 1,400 cartons of orange juice.</p>",
